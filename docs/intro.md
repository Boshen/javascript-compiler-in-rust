We are in [The Third Age of JavaScript](https://www.swyx.io/js-third-age/),
the common trend right now is to author JavaScript tools in Rust or Go for their performance gains.

But authoring JavaScript tools are hard, let alone writing them in Rust.
I have struggled a lot when learning these technologies,
and I wish less people to take the same struggling journey.

I want to make my own contribution to the community by writing this book for you,
so you don't have to take the same struggling journey as I had.

There are only a handful of developers on the Rust side, and I would like to see you here and join us,
so we can build better and faster tools for ourselves to enjoy.
