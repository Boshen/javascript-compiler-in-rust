We are in the [The Third Age of JavaScript](https://www.swyx.io/js-third-age/),
it is now the common trend to author JavaScript in Rust or Go for all the performance gains.

But authoring JavaScript tools are hard, let alone writing them in Rust.
I have struggled a lot when learning these technologies,
and I wish less people to take the same struggling journey.
I want to make my own contribution to the community by writing this book for you,
so you don't have to take the same struggled journey as I had.

There are only a handful of developers on the Rust side, and I would like to see you here and join us,
so we can build better and faster tools for ourselves to enjoy.

This book will make references to a lot of the existing technologies, you can visit the [references](/blog/references) page for details.
