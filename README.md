# Write a JavaScript Parser in Rust

Rust, JavaScript, and parsers are all hard to learn,
let's combine these three and challenge ourselves to write a JavaScript parser in Rust.

This will be the guide for you if you are interested in learning Rust, parsers,
or would like to contribute to [oxc](https://github.com/Boshen/oxc), [swc](https://swc.rs) or [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) in the near future.

The guide will cover all the basic topics of writing a JavaScript parser in rust.
The tutorials will explain some topics in more depth.
