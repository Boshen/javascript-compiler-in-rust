# Write a JavaScript Parser in Rust

(This is currently work in progress)

JavaScript, Rust and parsers are all hard to learn,
let's combine these three and challenge ourselves to write a JavaScript parser in Rust.

This will be the book for you if you are interested in learning Rust, parsers,
or would like to contribute to [swc](https://swc.rs) or [Rome](https://rome.tools) in the near future.

The book will cover all the basic topics of writing a JavaScript parser in rust.
And the tutorials will explain some topics in more depth.
