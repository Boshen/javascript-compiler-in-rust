# Write a JavaScript Parser in Rust

(This is currently work in progress)

Rust, JavaScript, and parsers are all hard to learn,
let's combine these three and challenge ourselves to write a JavaScript parser in Rust.

This will be the guide for you if you are interested in learning Rust, parsers,
or would like to contribute to [swc](https://swc.rs) or [Rome](https://rome.tools) in the near future.

The guide will cover all the basic topics of writing a JavaScript parser in rust.
The tutorials will explain some topics in more depth.
