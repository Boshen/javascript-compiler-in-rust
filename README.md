# JavaScript Compiler in Rust

(This is currently work in progress)

JavaScript, Rust and compilers are all hard to learn,
let's combine these three and challenge ourselves to write a JavaScript compiler in Rust.

This will be the book for you if you are interested in learning Rust, compiler technologies,
or would like to contribute to swc or Rome in the near future.

The book will be a full tutorial on writing a JavaScript compiler in Rust.
And the tutorials will go down rabbit holes on specific topics.
