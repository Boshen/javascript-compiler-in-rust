# Write a JavaScript Compiler in Rust

(This is currently work in progress)

JavaScript, Rust and compilers are all hard to learn,
let's combine these three and challenge ourselves to write a JavaScript compiler in Rust.

This will be the book for you if you are interested in learning Rust, compiler technologies,
or would like to contribute to [swc](https://swc.rs) or [Rome](https://rome.tools) in the near future.

The book will be a full tutorial on writing a JavaScript compiler in Rust.
And the tutorials will go down rabbit holes on specific topics.
